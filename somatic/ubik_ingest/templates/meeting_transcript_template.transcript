Speaker 1  0:00
Alright everyone, thanks for making time for this. I know we're all busy with the holidays coming up, but I wanted to make sure we're all on the same page about a few things.

Speaker 2  0:12
Of course. Should we start with the holiday plans? That's probably the most time-sensitive.

Speaker 1  0:18
Good idea. So, I talked to your Aunt Maria yesterday, and she's confirmed the Lake House is available from the 23rd through the 27th. What does everyone think?

Speaker 3  0:30
That works for me. I can drive up on the 23rd after my last final.

Speaker 4  0:35
Same here. I'm done with exams on the 21st, so I'm flexible. Actually, Dad, can I bring Maya? Her family is traveling and she'd be alone otherwise.

Speaker 1  0:45
Of course, mija. Maya is always welcome. Elena?

Speaker 2  0:50
That's perfect. I'll coordinate with Maria on the food. She mentioned wanting to do Christmas Eve dinner together, the whole extended family.

Speaker 1  1:02
Wonderful. Now, Sofia, I know you've been stressed about college decisions. Any updates you want to share?

Speaker 4  1:10
Actually, yes. I got my early admission letter from Berkeley yesterday.

Speaker 2  1:15
What?! Sofia! Why didn't you tell us immediately?

Speaker 4  1:20
I wanted to wait until we were all together. I got in, Mom. Full scholarship to the engineering program.

Speaker 1  1:28
That's incredible! I'm so proud of you. Come here.

Speaker 3  1:35
Congrats, sis. Though I'm now officially the underachieving sibling.

Speaker 4  1:40
Shut up, you're at Stanford. But actually, there's something else. I've been thinking about taking a gap semester first. Maybe doing some volunteer work abroad.

Speaker 2  1:52
A gap semester? That's... unexpected. What brought this on?

Speaker 4  2:00
I don't know, I just feel like I've been on this conveyor belt my whole life. School, activities, college apps. I want to actually experience something before diving into another four years.

Speaker 1  2:12
I think that's a very mature perspective. When I was your age, I wish I had taken time to explore before making big decisions.

Speaker 2  2:22
We should discuss this more, but I'm open to it. As long as you have a real plan, not just "traveling around."

Speaker 4  2:30
I'm looking at some structured programs. Engineers Without Borders has a semester in Peru that looks amazing.

Speaker 1  2:38
Research it properly and present us with a real proposal. We'll support whatever you decide.

Speaker 3  2:45
Speaking of projects, Dad, how's the UBIK thing going? You mentioned you were making progress.

Speaker 1  2:52
Ah, yes. Good transition. So, I've been working with Adrian on setting up the technical infrastructure. We have the memory system running, the transcription working. Now I need to actually start recording content.

Speaker 2  3:08
The stories and values you want to preserve?

Speaker 1  3:12
Exactly. I was thinking we could do regular recording sessions. Maybe once a month, I tell a story or discuss a topic, and we capture it all for the system.

Speaker 3  3:25
I can help with the technical side. Set up proper audio, maybe even video if you want.

Speaker 1  3:32
That would be wonderful. I want you all involved in this, actually. Not just as technical support, but as participants. There are family stories I only know parts of. Your grandmother's journey here, how your mother and I met, those are memories that belong to all of us.

Speaker 2  3:50
I'd like that. There's so much I never asked my parents before it was too late.

Speaker 1  4:00
That's exactly why I'm doing this. I don't want you kids to have those same regrets. And I want Sofia and Marco's children to know who we were, not just from photos but from our actual voices, our actual thoughts.

Speaker 4  4:15
It's kind of beautiful, Dad. Like a time capsule but alive.

Speaker 1  4:22
That's exactly what it is. A living time capsule. So, can we commit to a first session over the holidays? Maybe the day after Christmas?

Speaker 3  4:32
I'll have everything set up by then.

Speaker 2  4:35
What topic do you want to start with?

Speaker 1  4:40
I was thinking about how our family came to this country. The story of your great-grandparents. It's the foundation of everything we are.

Speaker 4  4:50
I'd love to hear that. I only know bits and pieces.

Speaker 1  4:55
Then it's settled. December 26th, we do our first official UBIK family recording session.

Speaker 2  5:02
Should we talk about New Year's Eve while we're at it?

Speaker 1  5:06
Good point. I was thinking we host everyone here. Keep it intimate, just family and close friends.

Speaker 3  5:15
Works for me. I can set up some music and stuff.

Speaker 2  5:18
I'll handle the food. Sofia, will Maya still be with us?

Speaker 4  5:22
Probably, yeah. Her parents don't get back until the 3rd.

Speaker 1  5:28
Perfect. Alright, I think we've covered everything on the agenda. Anything else anyone wants to bring up?

Speaker 3  5:35
One quick thing - Spring break. Some friends are planning a ski trip to Colorado. Can I go?

Speaker 2  5:42
When is it exactly?

Speaker 3  5:45
March 15th to 22nd. It's during Stanford's break.

Speaker 1  5:50
We don't have any conflicts that I know of. As long as it's with responsible people and you're safe.

Speaker 2  5:58
Let's talk details later, but preliminary yes.

Speaker 1  6:02
Alright everyone. Good meeting. I love you all. Now let's order some pizza.

Speaker 4  6:08
Finally! I'm starving.

Speaker 2  6:10
I'll order from Antonio's. Everyone want the usual?

Speaker 3  6:15
Yes please!
