# Letter to My Grandchildren

*December 2024*

Dear Sofia and Marco,

As I write this letter, you're probably still too young to fully understand it. Sofia, you're seven and more interested in your soccer team than your grandfather's ramblings. Marco, you just turned four and think I'm mainly useful for piggyback rides and sneaking you extra cookies when your parents aren't looking.

But someday, perhaps when you're my age, you might want to know who I was beyond the grandfather who showed up at holidays and birthdays. This letter is for that future version of you.

## What I Want You to Know About Life

I've learned that the most important things in life aren't the things at all. They're the moments. The connections. The quiet evenings when your grandmother and I sit on the porch and don't even need to talk because we've said everything and nothing all at once.

I made many mistakes in my life. I worked too hard when your parents were young. I missed school plays and soccer games because I thought providing for the family meant earning more money. It took me too long to realize that providing for a family means being present. Being there. Listening even when you're tired. Playing catch even when your back hurts.

By the time I understood this, your parents were nearly grown. But I got a second chance with you. Every moment I spend with you now is my way of correcting those old mistakes.

## A Story I Want You to Remember

When your father was about Sofia's age, I took him fishing at Lake Michigan. We drove three hours to get there, and he complained the whole way about being bored. When we finally got to the lake, we spent two hours setting up, and another hour waiting for a fish to bite.

Nothing happened. Not a single fish. Your father was frustrated, and honestly, so was I.

But then, just as the sun was setting and we were about to pack up, he looked at me and said, "Dad, can we come back tomorrow and try again?"

I realized then that the fishing wasn't the point. The point was being together. Trying together. Failing together and deciding to try again anyway. We did go back the next day, and we still didn't catch anything. But those two days are among my happiest memories.

That's what I want you to understand: the joy isn't in the catching. It's in the trying. It's in the company you keep while you try.

## What I Believe

I believe that every person deserves to be treated with dignity, regardless of where they come from or what they've accomplished. Your great-great-grandparents came to this country with nothing but hope and willingness to work. They were treated poorly by many people. They never became wealthy or famous. But they raised children who raised children who raised you. Their dignity persisted even when the world didn't recognize it.

I believe that honesty matters more than comfort. It's easy to tell people what they want to hear. It's harder, and more loving, to tell them what they need to hear. When you face hard truths in your life, I hope you'll choose honesty, even when it's painful.

I believe that family is the foundation of everything. Not just blood family, but the family you choose. The friends who become siblings. The mentors who become parents. Cherish these relationships. They are the only wealth that truly matters.

## My Hopes for You

I hope you find work that gives you meaning, not just money. I hope you find partners who see you clearly and love you anyway. I hope you experience failure, because it teaches more than success ever could. I hope you stay curious, keep asking questions, keep learning even when you think you know enough.

Most of all, I hope you know that you are deeply loved. Not for what you achieve, but for who you are. You were loved before you accomplished anything, and you will be loved long after any accomplishments are forgotten.

## Before I Go

If you're reading this after I'm gone, please don't be sad for too long. Death is simply the period at the end of a sentence. What matters is the story that came before it.

I lived. I loved. I made mistakes and tried to correct them. I watched sunsets with your grandmother and felt peace. I held you as babies and felt hope. I am part of you now, woven into your genes and your memories and the stories you'll tell your own children.

That's a kind of immortality, isn't it? Not living forever, but living on through the love we leave behind.

Thank you for being my grandchildren. Thank you for the piggyback rides and the soccer games and the sticky fingers from too many cookies. Thank you for making my final chapter the sweetest one.

With all the love a heart can hold,

**Grandpa Gines**

*P.S. - Sofia, practice your left foot. Marco, the cookies are hidden in the blue jar behind the flour. Don't tell your mother I told you.*
